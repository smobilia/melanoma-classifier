# Melanoma Project README file

## Project Summary
This project is for the development of Melanoma Classifier for the Kaggle SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification Contest

## Project Goals
The primary project goal is to develop a classifier that can detect instances of Melanoma from input images.

The secondary project goal is to get more experience working with PyTorch.

## Requirements

## How to Use These Files

## Data and Preprocessing

## CNN Implementation

## Conclusion

### Future Work
- Incorporate early stopping into the models.
- Incorporate metadata into the models.
- Incorporate more image processing and data augmentation on the images.

Thank you to Kaggle user Chris Deotte for providing the scaled jpg images that were used in these models.

I also liked the way that Kaggle user Vishnu organized his code [here](https://www.kaggle.com/vishnus/a-simple-pytorch-starter-code-single-fold-93 "Simple PyTorch Starter"), and I based some of my pipeline layout on this code.
